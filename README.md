# Strategy View Toggle Application

## Overview
The **Strategy View Toggle Application** is a web-based application that allows users to view various trading strategies based on different market conditions: Bullish, Bearish, Rangebound, and Volatile. Users can select a date to see available strategies and view them in an accordion-style layout.

## Features
- Toggle between different market views (Bullish, Bearish, Rangebound, Volatile).
- Select a date to view corresponding strategies.
- Display strategies in an accordion format, with counts indicating how many strategies are available.
- Handle empty states gracefully by informing users when no strategies are available for the selected date.

## Technologies Used
- **HTML**: For structuring the webpage.
- **CSS**: For styling the application.
- **JavaScript**: For dynamic interactivity and functionality.

## Accordion Implementation
The date selection dropdown is enhanced with an accordion-style display, showing the strategies available for each selected date. When a date is selected, the corresponding strategies are displayed or hidden accordingly.

## Example Usage
- When **Bullish** is selected, and **25-Apr-2024** is chosen, the user will see:
  - **Long Put** • 1 Strategy
  - **Bear Put Spread** • 6 Strategies
  - **Bear Call Spread** • 7 Strategies

- If no strategies are available for the selected date, an informative message will be displayed.
